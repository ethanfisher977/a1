<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name: Ethan Fisher</strong></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To create a small website for the company &quot;Slammers&quot; who specialise in Volleyball. This site will hopefully shine new light on the company and to introduce new customers to join in on the fun. The project is aimed at new families (18-30) so that it appeals to a younger audience. The company assumes that more people would attend/play at their facility if more people knew about them.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The company before the website creation usually hosts 100 people per week playing at slammers, the success evaluation is to increase the amount of players from the previous week.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the website is people/young families between the ages of 18-30.</p>
<h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
